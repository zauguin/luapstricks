## Usage

  1. Copy `pstricks.con`, `luapstricks.sty` and `luapstricks.lua` from this reppository into the directory of your TeX files or into another directory in your TeX search path.
  2. Add, *before* loading any `pstricks` related packages, the line `\usepackage{luapstricks}`. This will automatically load the `pstricks` package.
  3. Compile your document with `lualatex`.
  4. Given the current state of development of this project, the previous stage probably failed. Write a bug report to the author. Otherwise go to step 7.
  5. Wait for a fix.
  6. Go back to step 1 and try again. You can skip step 2 now since your file already loads the package :)
  7. It worked? That's great. Feel free to inform the author anyway and share the awesome images you created.
